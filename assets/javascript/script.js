// Gotta make variables for city name, apikey, maybe history storage to begin with


// After the city name is stored from the search Bar, I'll need to make an API call to get the information based on that city

// I'll need to push that information to my main and mini cards


// Make buttons that make that call

// Save city to local storage


// Make a call for the saved storage
